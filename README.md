New York City is one of the preferred destinations for around 5 million tourists every month. That's why it is a place where listing companies, such as Pillow Palooza can flourish by catering to the high demand for temporary lodging among travelers. In order to maximize revenue and occupancy rates for our company, I conducted an analysis of publicly available data from [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), a well-known player in the rental industry. Utilizing **`Python`** for data wrangling and cleaning, SQL for data exploration and gathering and, presenting the results through a **`Tableau`** dashboard, I got valuable insights and actionable recommendations to make our company succeed in the competitive rental market and attract potential investors.


## Context

In order to identify growth opportunities for Pillow Palooza I was provided with 3 different datasets (See figure 1) in three different formats ( .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx). Basically, the company is focused in uncover trends in popular neighbourhoods, rental prices, property types, length of stay and demand over time. Thatâ€™s why our team have come up with some strategic questions that I had to resolve: 

1.	What are the most popular neighbourhoods for short-term rentals in New York City?
2.	What is the average rental price for short-term rentals in New York City, and which neighbourhoods and property types have the higher average rental price? 
3.	What are the most commonly rented property types on Airbnb in New York City, and how does this vary by neighbourhood? 
4.	What is the average number of days short-term rentals in New York City are booked in a year, and how does this vary by neighbourhood and property type? 
5.	How has the demand for short-term rentals in New York City changed over time, and are there any monthly/seasonal trends that could impact business decisions?

Based on the insights generated from those questions I have to prepare some recommendations to help the company identify which neighbourhoods to invest in, which property types to focus on, and how to price their rentals to remain competitive in the market.

## Results

#### Data Wrangling and Cleaning

As the data came from different sources, it was necessary to ensure the information is accurate and reliable. Then, I used Python to import, join and clean the data. Some cleaning steps were performed in order to:
-	Evaluate data constraints such as removing units along with listing prices (see step 1 in the annexed jupyter notebook)
-	Convert inconsistent data types to the right type (e.g, in step 1 the strings were converted to numbers because are listing prices)
-	Find data range constraints (In step 3 I removed listing prices equal to 0, which wrongly indicates that those are free listings) 
-	Remove categorical data inconsistencies (see step 5 where the room type column was converted to lowercase to get just 3 unique categorical values)
-	Delete duplicates and missing values generated by merging the tables in step 7. 

As part of this data wrangling, I decide to create 2 new columns to help with the posterior data analysis: borough and monthly price. The first one was obtained from the preexistent nbhood_full column by splitting the categorical values (step 8). In this way, we can group the data either by neighbourhood or by borough. On the other hand, the monthly price column allows us to directly compare the Airbnb listing prices with the price of the private rental market.

#### Data Exploration with SQL

Once consistent and reliable datasets were obtained, a couple of requirements were returned to the data engineering team. The first one was to include the two new columns for boroughs and monthly listing prices. The second request was to add further information about the listings such as listing availability, booking timestamps, review dates, and number of listings per host.

The data engineer team kindly return me with the schema of Figure 1 where they included extra columns to enhance the analysis.

New York City is one of the preferred destinations for around 5 million tourists every month. That's why it is a place where a listing company, such as [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) can flourish by catering to the high demand for temporary lodging among travelers. Airbnb offers listings for stays ranging from a few nights to several months. In this notebook, I worked with datasets in a variety of formats( `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`) and cleaned the data to extract insights that can be used by the growth team of Pillow Palooza. The goal is to identify opportunities for success in the short-term rental market.
